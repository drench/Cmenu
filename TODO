***** improve field checking especially for numeric formats
      generally numeric data entry is very poor

***   add explicit field locations for data templates

*     add arrow pointer instead of bounce bar for really dumb terminals

**    add multicolumn facility

**    move button specs to menu_init routine
	its too tedious trying to manage this with menu_button_set calls
	also need to be able to hack button responses

**    need to be able to deal with edit fields which are wider than the
	space available in the editing window or span multiple lines
