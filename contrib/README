SQL Demo for perlCmenu
=======================
Contained here is a demo of SQL processing with perlCmenu
Dealing with return values from complex editing screens
can be tricky.

Files List
----------
README		this file
sqlmenu		the demonstration script

firstload/address.make	script to make a PostgreSQL database
firstload/food.make	script to make a PostgreSQL database

firstload/data/*	data for databases
firstload/sql/*		sql definitions for tables

Installation
------------
0. Hack all files to suit your SQL engine
   The provided files are for PostgreSQL

1. Make sure your SQL engine is up and running

2. Create a dbuser for the current user
   Create a database called home

3. Run address.make
   Run food.make
   These scripts create filled tables
   Make sure the tables exist OK

4. Make sure you have the Postgres module installed - this script
   use Pg.pm - the module distributed with PostgreSQL v7.0.3+
   There are other equivalent modules, such as Postgres and PgSQL;
   the sqlmenu script will need changed if you use one of these

5. If the SQL server is not on the localhost you can set
   PGHOST to point to the server. Current user is used.

6. Run the sqlmenu script

These are fairly trivial databases though their data entry
screens are not so trivial since they include radio lists
with regular data fields. Using the menu itself should be 
self-explanatory.

The most awkward example is editing of phone number fields.
This requires a text field with a radio list. Returned values
might be
  * no editing performed
  * data field was edited
  * only radio fields were edited
So there are several checks that must be performed to figure
which situation actually happened.
Note that only one radio or check list is supported per menu. 
A check list and a radio list can appear together but your
script will need to be able to distinguish between the 
relevant menu items.

I know, this is not very pretty.

Hope this helps
