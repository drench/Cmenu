DESCRIPTION:
------------

This is version 1.0 of Cmenu

Cmenu is a menuing system for perl scripts with a look and feel
reminiscient of dialog - the command line utility


COPYRIGHT:
----------

You may distribute under the terms of either the GNU General Public
License or the Artistic License, as specified in the Perl README file.


REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

  - build, test and install Perl5 
  - build, test and install Perl Module Curses.pm
  - build, test and install Perl Module Wrap.pm


PLATFORMS:
----------

  This release of Cmenu has been developed using Linux 2.2.
  It has been tested using these terminals
 	linux console
	xterm
	Wyse 60 using VT100 emulation (tic file supplied)


INSTALLATION:
-------------

0.   If you are not using Linux, read the source
     There are a couple of tweaks you may need to do to get
     some keys to respond correctly.
     Look around line 475 in function menu_initialise,
     Block 2 - methods 1,2 and 3
     If you need methods 1 or 2, uncomment them and comment out 3
     Sorry, I have nothing other than Linux here so do not know if 
     these methods are still necessary.
1.   perl Makefile.PL
2.   make
3.   demo
4.   make install (should be done under root)


TESTING:
--------

Run 'demo'.

This runs the perl script 'demo'. Provided you run it in Cmenu's
home directory it should be able to find Cmenu.pm without you
having to install Cmenu with 'make install'


DOCUMENTATION:
--------------

Detailed documentation can be found in the doc directory. Use
	latex Cmenu.tex			# needs TeX
	xdvi Cmenu.dvi			# needs XFree
	dvips -f Cmenu.dvi|lpr		# needs dvips
to process these files.

Use 'perldoc Cmenu' after installation to read the documentation 
included in the module itself for shorter function descriptions.

EXTRA FILES
-----------
The following files have been included as extras
   edit.txt	a help file used by demo
   help.txt	a help file used by demo
   cmenurc	a sample configuration file for hacking the default
		behaviour of Cmenu. It can reside in several places
			/etc/Cmenu/.cmenurc	System Wide
			~/.cmenurc		User defaults
			./cmenurc		Current deaults
		Config files are checked in the above precedence
   vt100-wy.ti	A tic file for the terminfo database. It is for
		a Wyse 60 (or equivalent) emulating a VT100. Extra
		function keys have been mapped to default strings
		so that Home and Page keys work. It is not perfect;
		the Delete key is mislabelled, some hacks of function
		keys may be required - at least its a start :)
   contrib/*	these are a series of scripts and definitions which
		create PostgreSQL databases and demonstrate Cmenu
		in action with SQL commands. Needs a PostgreSQL perl
		Module such as Pg or Postgres. Needs PostgreSQL as
		well of course.
